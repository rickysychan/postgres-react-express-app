# postgres-react-express-app

A simple application which combines Postgres, React, and Express. I built this to understand how the three applications work with each other.

it can do simple things like store, list, add, and deleting items from the postgres database which is accessed through the ORM Sequalize.

## To start

Run npm install on root and on server and than run 'yarn start:dev' on cli

## To use

This app doesn't have a front end, use Postman to make requests.
